# TuneWise

## What is TuneWise?

TuneWise is a music-based party game in the form of a lightweight mobile app
for you and your friends! The game allows a host to play a song from their
phone (possibly connected to a speaker), and the rest of the players try to
use the app to guess the name of the song being played. The player who guesses
correctly gets to choose the next song to play!

TuneWise was originally created for Tufts Polyhack 2019, though we intend to
carry on the project and continue to improve it.

## Technologies Used
The front end of the application was originally built in React Native, with
designs made using Sketch. The back end was built using Node.js with MongoDB
for storage and persistence.
